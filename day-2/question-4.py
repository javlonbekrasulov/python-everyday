"""
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console 
and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:

['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question,
it should be assumed to be a console input.tuple() method can convert list to tuple
"""

user_input = input("Number: ")

list = list(user_input.split(",")) #.split() is a built in function that splits the input, splits it by ","
tuple = tuple(list)

print(list)
print(tuple)
